## ‚ö° Performance Tips

### CPU vs GPU

- **CPU Processing**: Works but slow (~90 seconds per 200 characters)
- **GPU Processing**: 10-20x faster with CUDA-enabled NVIDIA GPUs
- For production use, GPU acceleration is strongly recommended

### Best Practices

- Keep individual text generations under 1000 characters for faster processing
- Record voice samples in a quiet environment
- Use high-quality audio (44.1kHz sample rate) for best cloning results
- Close other applications when processing audio

## üîß Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# API Settings
API_HOST=127.0.0.1
API_PORT=8000

# Audio Settings
AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE=44100
MAX_RECORDING_DURATION=300

# Model Settings (for GPU users)
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0  # Set your GPU device ID

# Theme
THEME=dark  # or "light"
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"API server not available"**
- Ensure the API server is running (`python run_api.py`)
- Check that port 8000 is not in use

**Voice cloning fails**
- Ensure audio is clear with minimal background noise
- Try recording a longer sample (20-30 seconds)
- Check that the audio file is in WAV format

**Slow audio generation**
- This is normal on CPU - consider using a GPU
- Try shorter text segments
- Close other applications to free up resources
